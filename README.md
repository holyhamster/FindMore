<b>Hotkeys: </b>

- CTRL + Q -- open a new panel
- ALT + Q -- cycle focus between panels (open a new one if none exists)
- CTRL + Y -- save all panels from the current page
- CTRL + B -- load saved setup into the page

<b>Technical info: </b>

- Background.js is run as a service worker to listen to hotkey commands, messages from popup page and active tab.
- Individual searches exist within the page javascript: Content-main.js is injected in every page and creates new Search instances on command from the service worker.
- Search uses DomCrawler to comb through the page DOM tree and sends all matches to Highlighter
- IntersectionObserver library is used by Highlighter to coordinate different stages of drawing process to minimize reflow calls to the browser.
- Popup.html with popup.js send option changes and save/load events to service worker.

<b>Known issues:</b>

Some websites capture input and prevent keyboard presses from reaching search ui.
